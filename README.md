# Conditional DCGAN

Original paper: [Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets](http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784), M.mirza et al.

The conditional generative adversarial networks, or cGAN for short, is a type of GAN that involves the conditional generation of images by a generator model. Image generation can be conditional on a class label, if available, allowing the targeted generation of images of a given type.
